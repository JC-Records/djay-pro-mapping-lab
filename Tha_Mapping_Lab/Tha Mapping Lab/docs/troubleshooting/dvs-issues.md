# Common DVS Issues in djay pro

## Timecode not detected

- Check RCA cables and connections.
- Make sure the interface is set to **line** level, not phono (unless it has built-in phono preamps).
- Increase input gain slightly.

## Calibration unstable

- Ground your turntables properly.
- Move speakers away from the decks.
- Try a different timecode record if the current one is badly worn.

## Audio dropouts / latency

- Reduce buffer size step by step until it clicks, then back off one step.
- Close unnecessary background apps.
- Use wired connections, avoid USB hubs when possible.
